"Lua is an extension programming language designed to support general procedural programming with data description facilities.",
"It also offers good support for object-oriented programming, functional programming, and data-driven programming.",
"Lua is intended to be used as a powerful, lightweight, embeddable scripting language for any program that needs one.",
"Lua is implemented as a library, written in clean C, the common subset of Standard C and C++.",
"\4",
"Being an extension language, Lua has no notion of a \"main\" program: it only works embedded in a host client, called the embedding program or simply the host.",
"The host program can invoke functions to execute a piece of Lua code, can write and read Lua variables, and can register C functions to be called by Lua code.",
"Through the use of C functions, Lua can be augmented to cope with a wide range of different domains, thus creating customized programming languages sharing a syntactical framework.",
"The Lua distribution includes a sample host program called \"lua\", which uses the Lua library to offer a complete, standalone Lua interpreter, for interactive or batch use.",
"\4",
"Lua is free software, and is provided as usual with no guarantees, as stated in its license.",
"The implementation described in this manual is available at Lua's official web site, \"www.lua.org\".",
"\4",
"Like any other reference manual, this document is dry in places.",
"For a discussion of the decisions behind the design of Lua, see the technical papers available at Lua's web site.",

{ title = "2. Basic Concepts", typ = 1;
"\4",
"This section describes the basic concepts of the language.",
{ title = "2.1 Values and Types", typ = 1;
"\4",
"Lua is a dynamically typed language.",
"This means that variables do not have types; only values do.",
"There are no type definitions in the language.",
"All values carry their own type.",
"\4",
"All values in Lua are first-class values.",
"This means that all values can be stored in variables, passed as arguments to other functions, and returned as results.",
"\4",
"There are eight basic types in Lua: nil, boolean, number, string, function, userdata, thread, and table.",
"Nil is the type of the value nil, whose main property is to be different from any other value; it usually represents the absence of a useful value.",
"Boolean is the type of the values false and true.",
"Both nil and false make a condition false; any other value makes it true.",
"Number represents real (double-precision floating-point) numbers.",
"Operations on numbers follow the same rules of the underlying C implementation, which, in turn, usually follows the IEEE 754 standard.",
"(It is easy to build Lua interpreters that use other internal representations for numbers, such as single-precision floats or long integers; see file \"luaconf.h\".)",
"String represents immutable sequences of bytes.",
"Lua is 8-bit clean: strings can contain any 8-bit value, including embedded zeros (\"\\0\").",
"\4",
"Lua can call (and manipulate) functions written in Lua and functions written in C (see §3.4.9).",
"\4",
"The type userdata is provided to allow arbitrary C data to be stored in Lua variables.",
"A userdata value is a pointer to a block of raw memory.",
"There are two kinds of userdata: full userdata, where the block of memory is managed by Lua, and light userdata, where the block of memory is managed by the host.",
"Userdata has no predefined operations in Lua, except assignment and identity test.",
"By using metatables, the programmer can define operations for full userdata values (see §2.4).",
"Userdata values cannot be created or modified in Lua, only through the C API.",
"This guarantees the integrity of data owned by the host program.",
"\4",
"The type thread represents independent threads of execution and it is used to implement coroutines (see §2.6).",
"Do not confuse Lua threads with operating-system threads.",
"Lua supports coroutines on all systems, even those that do not support threads.",
"\4",
"The type table implements associative arrays, that is, arrays that can be indexed not only with numbers, but with any Lua value except nil and NaN (Not a Number, a special numeric value used to represent undefined or unrepresentable results, such as \"0/0\").",
"Tables can be heterogeneous; that is, they can contain values of all types (except nil).",
"Any key with value nil is not considered part of the table.",
"Conversely, any key that is not part of a table has an associated value nil.",
"\4",
"Tables are the sole data structuring mechanism in Lua; they can be used to represent ordinary arrays, sequences, symbol tables, sets, records, graphs, trees, etc.",
"To represent records, Lua uses the field name as an index.",
"The language supports this representation by providing \"a.name\" as syntactic sugar for \"a['name']\".",
"There are several convenient ways to create tables in Lua (see §3.4.8).",
"\4",
"We use the term sequence to denote a table where the set of all positive numeric keys is equal to {1..n} for some integer n, which is called the length of the sequence (see §3.4.6).",
"\4",
"Like indices, the values of table fields can be of any type.",
"In particular, because functions are first-class values, table fields can contain functions.",
"Thus tables can also carry methods (see §3.4.10).",
"\4",
"The indexing of tables follows the definition of raw equality in the language.",
"The expressions \"a[i]\" and \"a[j]\" denote the same table element if and only if \"i\" and \"j\" are raw equal (that is, equal without metamethods).",
"\4",
"Tables, functions, threads, and (full) userdata values are objects: variables do not actually contain these values, only references to them.",
"Assignment, parameter passing, and function returns always manipulate references to such values; these operations do not imply any kind of copy.",
"\4",
"The library function \"type\" returns a string describing the type of a given value (see §6.1).",
},
{ title = "2.2 Environments and the Global Environment", typ = 1;
"\4",
"As will be discussed in §3.2 and §3.3.3, any reference to a global name \"var\" is syntactically translated to \"_ENV.var\".",
"Moreover, every chunk is compiled in the scope of an external local variable called \"_ENV\" (see §3.3.2), so \"_ENV\" itself is never a global name in a chunk.",
"\4",
"Despite the existence of this external \"_ENV\" variable and the translation of global names, \"_ENV\" is a completely regular name.",
"In particular, you can define new variables and parameters with that name.",
"Each reference to a global name uses the \"_ENV\" that is visible at that point in the program, following the usual visibility rules of Lua (see §3.5).",
"\4",
"Any table used as the value of \"_ENV\" is called an environment.",
"\4",
"Lua keeps a distinguished environment called the global environment.",
"This value is kept at a special index in the C registry (see §4.5).",
"In Lua, the variable \"_G\" is initialized with this same value.",
"\4",
"When Lua compiles a chunk, it initializes the value of its \"_ENV\" upvalue with the global environment (see \"load\").",
"Therefore, by default, global variables in Lua code refer to entries in the global environment.",
"Moreover, all standard libraries are loaded in the global environment and several functions there operate on that environment.",
"You can use \"load\" (or \"loadfile\") to load a chunk with a different environment.",
"(In C, you have to load the chunk and then change the value of its first upvalue.)",
"\4",
"If you change the global environment in the registry (through C code or the debug library), all chunks loaded after the change will get the new environment.",
"Previously loaded chunks are not affected, however, as each has its own reference to the environment in its \"_ENV\" variable.",
"Moreover, the variable \"_G\" (which is stored in the original global environment) is never updated by Lua.",
},
{ title = "2.3 Error Handling", typ = 1;
"\4",
"Because Lua is an embedded extension language, all Lua actions start from C code in the host program calling a function from the Lua library (see \"lua_pcall\").",
"Whenever an error occurs during the compilation or execution of a Lua chunk, control returns to the host, which can take appropriate measures (such as printing an error message).",
"\4",
"Lua code can explicitly generate an error by calling the \"error\" function.",
"If you need to catch errors in Lua, you can use \"pcall\" or \"xpcall\" to call a given function in protected mode.",
"\4",
"Whenever there is an error, an error object (also called an error message) is propagated with information about the error.",
"Lua itself only generates errors where the error object is a string, but programs may generate errors with any value for the error object.",
"\4",
"When you use \"xpcall\" or \"lua_pcall\", you may give a message handler to be called in case of errors.",
"This function is called with the original error message and returns a new error message.",
"It is called before the error unwinds the stack, so that it can gather more information about the error, for instance by inspecting the stack and creating a stack traceback.",
"This message handler is still protected by the protected call; so, an error inside the message handler will call the message handler again.",
"If this loop goes on, Lua breaks it and returns an appropriate message.",
},
{ title = "2.4 Metatables and Metamethods", typ = 1;
"\4",
"Every value in Lua can have a metatable.",
"This metatable is an ordinary Lua table that defines the behavior of the original value under certain special operations.",
"You can change several aspects of the behavior of operations over a value by setting specific fields in its metatable.",
"For instance, when a non-numeric value is the operand of an addition, Lua checks for a function in the field \"__add\" of the value's metatable.",
"If it finds one, Lua calls this function to perform the addition.",
"\4",
"The keys in a metatable are derived from the event names; the corresponding values are called metamethods.",
"In the previous example, the event is \"add\" and the metamethod is the function that performs the addition.",
"\4",
"You can query the metatable of any value using the \"getmetatable\" function.",
"\4",
"You can replace the metatable of tables using the \"setmetatable\" function.",
"You cannot change the metatable of other types from Lua (except by using the debug library); you must use the C API for that.",
"\4",
"Tables and full userdata have individual metatables (although multiple tables and userdata can share their metatables).",
"Values of all other types share one single metatable per type; that is, there is one single metatable for all numbers, one for all strings, etc.",
"By default, a value has no metatable, but the string library sets a metatable for the string type (see §6.4).",
"\4",
"A metatable controls how an object behaves in arithmetic operations, order comparisons, concatenation, length operation, and indexing.",
"A metatable also can define a function to be called when a userdata or a table is garbage collected.",
"When Lua performs one of these operations over a value, it checks whether this value has a metatable with the corresponding event.",
"If so, the value associated with that key (the metamethod) controls how Lua will perform the operation.",
"\4",
"Metatables control the operations listed next.",
"Each operation is identified by its corresponding name.",
"The key for each operation is a string with its name prefixed by two underscores, \"__\"; for instance, the key for operation \"add\" is the string \"__add\".",
"\4",
"The semantics of these operations is better explained by a Lua function describing how the interpreter executes the operation.",
"The code shown here in Lua is only illustrative; the real behavior is hard coded in the interpreter and it is much more efficient than this simulation.",
"All functions used in these descriptions (\"rawget\", \"tonumber\", etc.)",
"are described in §6.1.",
"In particular, to retrieve the metamethod of a given object, we use the expression",
"\3     metatable(obj)[event]",
"\4",
"This should be read as",
"\3     rawget(getmetatable(obj) or {}, event)",
"\4",
"This means that the access to a metamethod does not invoke other metamethods, and access to objects with no metatables does not fail (it simply results in nil).",
"\4",
"For the unary \"-\" and \"#\" operators, the metamethod is called with a dummy second argument.",
"This extra argument is only to simplify Lua's internals; it may be removed in future versions and therefore it is not present in the following code.",
"(For most uses this extra argument is irrelevant.)",
"\2\"add\":  the \"+\" operation.",
"\4",
"The function \"getbinhandler\" below defines how Lua chooses a handler for a binary operation.",
"First, Lua tries the first operand.",
"If its type does not define a handler for the operation, then Lua tries the second operand.",

"\4",
"Lua performs automatic memory management.",
"This means that you have to worry neither about allocating memory for new objects nor about freeing it when the objects are no longer needed.",
"Lua manages memory automatically by running a garbage collector to collect all dead objects (that is, objects that are no longer accessible from Lua).",
"All memory used by Lua is subject to automatic management: strings, tables, userdata, functions, threads, internal structures, etc.",
"\4",
"Lua implements an incremental mark-and-sweep collector.",
"It uses two numbers to control its garbage-collection cycles: the garbage-collector pause and the garbage-collector step multiplier.",
"Both use percentage points as units (e.g., a value of 100 means an internal value of 1).",
"\4",
"The garbage-collector pause controls how long the collector waits before starting a new cycle.",
"Larger values make the collector less aggressive.",
"Values smaller than 100 mean the collector will not wait to start a new cycle.",
"A value of 200 means that the collector waits for the total memory in use to double before starting a new cycle.",
"\4",
"The garbage-collector step multiplier controls the relative speed of the collector relative to memory allocation.",
"Larger values make the collector more aggressive but also increase the size of each incremental step.",
"Values smaller than 100 make the collector too slow and can result in the collector never finishing a cycle.",
"The default is 200, which means that the collector runs at \"twice\" the speed of memory allocation.",
"\4",
"If you set the step multiplier to a very large number (larger than 10% of the maximum number of bytes that the program may use), the collector behaves like a stop-the-world collector.",
"If you then set the pause to 200, the collector behaves as in old Lua versions, doing a complete collection every time Lua doubles its memory usage.",
"\4",
"You can change these numbers by calling \"lua_gc\" in C or \"collectgarbage\" in Lua.",
"You can also use these functions to control the collector directly (e.g., stop and restart it).",
"\4",
"As an experimental feature in Lua 5.2, you can change the collector's operation mode from incremental to generational.",
"A generational collector assumes that most objects die young, and therefore it traverses only young (recently created) objects.",
"This behavior can reduce the time used by the collector, but also increases memory usage (as old dead objects may accumulate).",
"To mitigate this second problem, from time to time the generational collector performs a full collection.",
"Remember that this is an experimental feature; you are welcome to try it, but check your gains.",
{ title = "2.5.1 Garbage-Collection Metamethods", typ = 1;
"\4",
"You can set garbage-collector metamethods for tables and, using the C API, for full userdata (see §2.4).",
"These metamethods are also called finalizers.",
"Finalizers allow you to coordinate Lua's garbage collection with external resource management (such as closing files, network or database connections, or freeing your own memory).",
"\4",
"For an object (table or userdata) to be finalized when collected, you must mark it for finalization.",

"The weakness of a table is controlled by the \"__mode\" field of its metatable.",
"If the \"__mode\" field is a string containing the character \"k\", the keys in the table are weak.",
"If \"__mode\" contains \"v\", the values in the table are weak.",

"A table with weak keys and strong values is also called an ephemeron table.",
"In an ephemeron table, a value is considered reachable only if its key is reachable.",
"In particular, if the only reference to a key comes through its value, the pair is removed.",

"Any change in the weakness of a table may take effect only at the next collect cycle.",
"In particular, if you change the weakness to a stronger mode, Lua may still collect some items from that table before the change takes effect.",

"Only objects that have an explicit construction are removed from weak tables.",
"Values, such as numbers and light C functions, are not subject to garbage collection, and therefore are not removed from weak tables (unless its associated value is collected).",

"\4",
"Resurrected objects (that is, objects being finalized and objects accessible only through objects being finalized) have a special behavior in weak tables.",
"They are removed from weak values before running their finalizers, but are removed from weak keys only in the next collection after running their finalizers, when such objects are actually freed.",

"Extra arguments passed to \"coroutine.resume\" are passed on to the coroutine main function.",
"After the coroutine starts running, it runs until it terminates or yields.",
"\4",
"A coroutine can terminate its execution in two ways: normally, when its main function returns (explicitly or implicitly, after the last instruction); and abnormally, if there is an unprotected error.",
"In the first case, \"coroutine.resume\" returns true, plus any values returned by the coroutine main function.",
"In case of errors, \"coroutine.resume\" returns false plus an error message.",
"\4",
"A coroutine yields by calling \"coroutine.yield\".",
"When a coroutine yields, the corresponding \"coroutine.resume\" returns immediately, even if the yield happens inside nested function calls (that is, not in the main function, but in a function directly or indirectly called by the main function).",
"In the case of a yield, \"coroutine.resume\" also returns true, plus any values passed to \"coroutine.yield\".",
"The next time you resume the same coroutine, it continues its execution from the point where it yielded, with the call to \"coroutine.yield\" returning any extra arguments passed to \"coroutine.resume\".",
"\4",
"Like \"coroutine.create\", the \"coroutine.wrap\" function also creates a coroutine, but instead of returning the coroutine itself, it returns a function that, when called, resumes the coroutine.",

"A backslash followed by a real newline results in a newline in the string.",

"This can be done with the escape sequence \"\\xXX\", where XX is a sequence of exactly two hexadecimal digits, or with the escape sequence \"\\ddd\", where ddd is a sequence of up to three decimal digits.",
"(Note that if a decimal escape is to be followed by a digit, it must be expressed using exactly three digits.)",
"Strings in Lua can contain any 8-bit value, including embedded zeros, which can be specified as \"\\0\".",
"\4",
"Literal strings can also be defined using a long format enclosed by long brackets.",
"We define an opening long bracket of level n as an opening square bracket followed by n equal signs followed by another opening square bracket.",
"So, an opening long bracket of level 0 is written as \"[[\", an opening long bracket of level 1 is written as \"[=[\", and so on.",
"A closing long bracket is defined similarly; for instance, a closing long bracket of level 4 is written as \"]====]\".",
"A long literal starts with an opening long bracket of any level and ends at the first closing long bracket of the same level.",
"It can contain any text except a closing bracket of the proper level.",
"Literals in this bracketed form can run for several lines, do not interpret any escape sequences, and ignore long brackets of any other level.",
"Any kind of end-of-line sequence (carriage return, newline, carriage return followed by newline, or newline followed by carriage return) is converted to a simple newline.",
"\4",
"Any byte in a literal string not explicitly affected by the previous rules represents itself.",
