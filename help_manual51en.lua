"Lua is an extension programming language designed to support general procedural programming with data description facilities.",
"It also offers good support for object-oriented programming, functional programming, and data-driven programming.",
"Lua is intended to be used as a powerful, light-weight scripting language for any program that needs one.",
"Lua is implemented as a library, written in clean C (that is, in the common subset of ANSI C and C++).",
"\4",
"Being an extension language, Lua has no notion of a \"main\" program: it only works embedded in a host client, called the embedding program or simply the host.",
"This host program can invoke functions to execute a piece of Lua code, can write and read Lua variables, and can register C functions to be called by Lua code.",
"Through the use of C functions, Lua can be augmented to cope with a wide range of different domains, thus creating customized programming languages sharing a syntactical framework.",
"The Lua distribution includes a sample host program called \"lua\", which uses the Lua library to offer a complete, stand-alone Lua interpreter.",
"\4",
"Lua is free software, and is provided as usual with no guarantees, as stated in its license.",
"The implementation described in this manual is available at Lua's official web site, \"www.lua.org\".",
"\4",
"Like any other reference manual, this document is dry in places.",
"For a discussion of the decisions behind the design of Lua, see the technical papers available at Lua's web site.",
"For a detailed introduction to programming in Lua, see Roberto's book, Programming in Lua (Second Edition).",

"This section describes the lexis, the syntax, and the semantics of Lua.",
"In other words, this section describes which tokens are valid, how they can be combined, and what their combinations mean.",
"\4",
"The language constructs will be explained using the usual extended BNF notation, in which {a} means 0 or more a's, and [a] means an optional a.",
"Non-terminals are shown like non-terminal, keywords are shown like kword, and other terminal symbols are shown like `=´.",
"The complete syntax of Lua can be found in §8 at the end of this manual.",
{ title = "2.1 Lexical Conventions", typ = 1;
"\4",
"Names (also called identifiers) in Lua can be any string of letters, digits, and underscores, not beginning with a digit.",
"This coincides with the definition of names in most languages.",
"(The definition of letter depends on the current locale: any character considered alphabetic by the current locale can be used in an identifier.)",
"Identifiers are used to name variables and table fields.",
"\4",
"The following keywords are reserved and cannot be used as names:",
"\3     and       break     do        else      elseif",
"\3     end       false     for       function  if",

"\3     repeat    return    then      true      until     while",
"\4",
"Lua is a case-sensitive language: \"and\" is a reserved word, but \"And\" and \"AND\" are two different, valid names.",
"As a convention, names starting with an underscore followed by uppercase letters (such as \"_VERSION\") are reserved for internal global variables used by Lua.",
"\4",
"The following strings denote other tokens:",
"\3     +     -     *     /     %     ^     #",
"\3     ==    ~=    <=    >=    <     >     =",
"\3     (     )     {     }     [     ]",
"\3     ;     :     ,     .     ..    ...",
"\4",
"Literal strings can be delimited by matching single or double quotes, and can contain the following C-like escape sequences: \"\\a\" (bell), \"\\b\" (backspace), \"\\f\" (form feed), \"\\n\" (newline), \"\\r\" (carriage return), \"\\t\" (horizontal tab), \"\\v\" (vertical tab), \"\\\\\" (backslash), \"\\'\" (quotation mark [double quote]), and \"\\'\" (apostrophe [single quote]).",
"Moreover, a backslash followed by a real newline results in a newline in the string.",
"A character in a string can also be specified by its numerical value using the escape sequence \"\\ddd\", where ddd is a sequence of up to three decimal digits.",
"(Note that if a numerical escape is to be followed by a digit, it must be expressed using exactly three digits.)",
"Strings in Lua can contain any 8-bit value, including embedded zeros, which can be specified as \"\\0\".",
"\4",
"Literal strings can also be defined using a long format enclosed by long brackets.",
"We define an opening long bracket of level n as an opening square bracket followed by n equal signs followed by another opening square bracket.",
"So, an opening long bracket of level 0 is written as \"[[\", an opening long bracket of level 1 is written as \"[=[\", and so on.",
"A closing long bracket is defined similarly; for instance, a closing long bracket of level 4 is written as \"]====]\".",
"A long string starts with an opening long bracket of any level and ends at the first closing long bracket of the same level.",
"Literals in this bracketed form can run for several lines, do not interpret any escape sequences, and ignore long brackets of any other level.",
"They can contain anything except a closing bracket of the proper level.",
"\4",
"For convenience, when the opening long bracket is immediately followed by a newline, the newline is not included in the string.",
"As an example, in a system using ASCII (in which \"a\" is coded as 97, newline is coded as 10, and \"1\" is coded as 49), the five literal strings below denote the same string:",
"\3     a = 'alo\\n123\"'",
"\3     a = \"alo\\n123\\\"\"",
"\3     a = '\\97lo\\10\\04923\"'",
"\3     a = [[alo",

"\3     a = [==[",
"\3     alo",
"\3     123\"]==]",
"\4",
"A numerical constant can be written with an optional decimal part and an optional decimal exponent.",
"Lua also accepts integer hexadecimal constants, by prefixing them with \"0x\".",
"Examples of valid numerical constants are",
"\3     3   3.0   3.1416   314.16e-2   0.31416E1   0xff   0x56",
"\4",
"A comment starts with a double hyphen (\"--\") anywhere outside a string.",
"If the text immediately after \"--\" is not an opening long bracket, the comment is a short comment, which runs until the end of the line.",
"Otherwise, it is a long comment, which runs until the corresponding closing long bracket.",
"Long comments are frequently used to disable code temporarily.",
},
{ title = "2.2 Values and Types", typ = 1;
"\4",
"Lua is a dynamically typed language.",
"This means that variables do not have types; only values do.",
"There are no type definitions in the language.",
"All values carry their own type.",
"\4",
"All values in Lua are first-class values.",
"This means that all values can be stored in variables, passed as arguments to other functions, and returned as results.",
"\4",
"There are eight basic types in Lua: nil, boolean, number, string, function, userdata, thread, and table.",
"Nil is the type of the value nil, whose main property is to be different from any other value; it usually represents the absence of a useful value.",
"Boolean is the type of the values false and true.",
"Both nil and false make a condition false; any other value makes it true.",
"Number represents real (double-precision floating-point) numbers.",
"(It is easy to build Lua interpreters that use other internal representations for numbers, such as single-precision float or long integers; see file \"luaconf.h\".)",
"String represents arrays of characters.",
"Lua is 8-bit clean: strings can contain any 8-bit character, including embedded zeros (\"\\0\") (see §2.1).",
"\4",
"Lua can call (and manipulate) functions written in Lua and functions written in C (see §2.5.8).",
"\4",
"The type userdata is provided to allow arbitrary C data to be stored in Lua variables.",
"This type corresponds to a block of raw memory and has no pre-defined operations in Lua, except assignment and identity test.",
"However, by using metatables, the programmer can define operations for userdata values (see §2.8).",
"Userdata values cannot be created or modified in Lua, only through the C API.",
"This guarantees the integrity of data owned by the host program.",
"\4",
"The type thread represents independent threads of execution and it is used to implement coroutines (see §2.11).",
"Do not confuse Lua threads with operating-system threads.",
"Lua supports coroutines on all systems, even those that do not support threads.",
"\4",
"The type table implements associative arrays, that is, arrays that can be indexed not only with numbers, but with any value (except nil).",
"Tables can be heterogeneous; that is, they can contain values of all types (except nil).",
"Tables are the sole data structuring mechanism in Lua; they can be used to represent ordinary arrays, symbol tables, sets, records, graphs, trees, etc.",
"To represent records, Lua uses the field name as an index.",
"The language supports this representation by providing \"a.name\" as syntactic sugar for \"a['name']\".",
"There are several convenient ways to create tables in Lua (see §2.5.7).",
"\4",
"Like indices, the value of a table field can be of any type (except nil).",
"In particular, because functions are first-class values, table fields can contain functions.",
"Thus tables can also carry methods (see §2.5.9).",
"\4",
"Tables, functions, threads, and (full) userdata values are objects: variables do not actually contain these values, only references to them.",
"Assignment, parameter passing, and function returns always manipulate references to such values; these operations do not imply any kind of copy.",
"\4",
"The library function \"type\" returns a string describing the type of a given value.",
{ title = "2.2.1 Coercion", typ = 1;
"\4",
"Lua provides automatic conversion between string and number values at run time.",
"Any arithmetic operation applied to a string tries to convert this string to a number, following the usual conversion rules.",
"Conversely, whenever a number is used where a string is expected, the number is converted to a string, in a reasonable format.",
"For complete control over how numbers are converted to strings, use the \"format\" function from the string library (see \"string.format\").",
},
},
{ title = "2.3 Variables", typ = 1;
"\4",
"Variables are places that store values.",
"There are three kinds of variables in Lua: global variables, local variables, and table fields.",
"\4",
"A single name can denote a global variable or a local variable (or a function's formal parameter, which is a particular kind of local variable):",
"\3\9var ::= Name",
"\4",
"Name denotes identifiers, as defined in §2.1.",
"\4",
"Any variable is assumed to be global unless explicitly declared as a local (see §2.4.7).",
"Local variables are lexically scoped: local variables can be freely accessed by functions defined inside their scope (see §2.6).",
"\4",
"Before the first assignment to a variable, its value is nil.",
"\4",
"Square brackets are used to index a table:",
"\3\9var ::= prefixexp `[´ exp `]´",
"\4",
"The meaning of accesses to global variables and table fields can be changed via metatables.",
"An access to an indexed variable \"t[i]\" is equivalent to a call \"gettable_event(t,i)\".",
"(See §2.8 for a complete description of the \"gettable_event\" function.",
"This function is not defined or callable in Lua.",
"We use it here only for explanatory purposes.)",
"\4",
"The syntax \"var.Name\" is just syntactic sugar for \"var['Name']\":",
"\3\9var ::= prefixexp `.´ Name",
"\4",
"All global variables live as fields in ordinary Lua tables, called environment tables or simply environments (see §2.9).",
"Each function has its own reference to an environment, so that all global variables in this function will refer to this environment table.",
"When a function is created, it inherits the environment from the function that created it.",
"To get the environment table of a Lua function, you call \"getfenv\".",
"To replace it, you call \"setfenv\".",
"(You can only manipulate the environment of C functions through the debug library; (see §5.9).)",
"\4",
"An access to a global variable \"x\" is equivalent to \"_env.x\", which in turn is equivalent to",
"\3     gettable_event(_env, \"x\")",
"\4",
"where \"_env\" is the environment of the running function.",
"(See §2.8 for a complete description of the \"gettable_event\" function.",
"This function is not defined or callable in Lua.",
"Similarly, the \"_env\" variable is not defined in Lua.",
"We use them here only for explanatory purposes.)",
},
{ title = "2.4 Statements", typ = 1;
"\4",
"Lua supports an almost conventional set of statements, similar to those in Pascal or C.",
"This set includes assignments, control structures, function calls, and variable declarations.",
{ title = "2.4.1 Chunks", typ = 1;
"\4",
"The unit of execution of Lua is called a chunk.",
"A chunk is simply a sequence of statements, which are executed sequentially.",
"Each statement can be optionally followed by a semicolon:",
"\3\9chunk ::= {stat [`;´]}",
"\4",
"There are no empty statements and thus \";;\" is not legal.",
"\4",
"Lua handles a chunk as the body of an anonymous function with a variable number of arguments (see §2.5.9).",
"As such, chunks can define local variables, receive arguments, and return values.",
"\4",
"A chunk can be stored in a file or in a string inside the host program.",
"To execute a chunk, Lua first pre-compiles the chunk into instructions for a virtual machine, and then it executes the compiled code with an interpreter for the virtual machine.",
"\4",
"Chunks can also be pre-compiled into binary form; see program \"luac\" for details.",
"Programs in source and compiled forms are interchangeable; Lua automatically detects the file type and acts accordingly.",
},
{ title = "2.4.2 Blocks", typ = 1;
"\4",
"A block is a list of statements; syntactically, a block is the same as a chunk:",
"\3\9block ::= chunk",
"\4",
"A block can be explicitly delimited to produce a single statement:",
"\3\9stat ::= do block end",
"\4",
"Explicit blocks are useful to control the scope of variable declarations.",
"Explicit blocks are also sometimes used to add a return or break statement in the middle of another block (see §2.4.4).",
},
{ title = "2.4.3 Assignment", typ = 1;
"\4",
"Lua allows multiple assignments.",
"Therefore, the syntax for assignment defines a list of variables on the left side and a list of expressions on the right side.",
"The elements in both lists are separated by commas:",
"\3\9stat ::= varlist `=´ explist",
"\3\9varlist ::= var {`,´ var}",
"\3\9explist ::= exp {`,´ exp}",
"\4",
"Expressions are discussed in §2.5.",
"\4",
"Before the assignment, the list of values is adjusted to the length of the list of variables.",
"If there are more values than needed, the excess values are thrown away.",
"If there are fewer values than needed, the list is extended with as many  nil's as needed.",
"If the list of expressions ends with a function call, then all values returned by that call enter the list of values, before the adjustment (except when the call is enclosed in parentheses; see §2.5).",
"\4",
"The assignment statement first evaluates all its expressions and only then are the assignments performed.",
"Thus the code",
"\3     i = 3",
"\3     i, a[i] = i+1, 20",
"\4",
"sets \"a[3]\" to 20, without affecting \"a[4]\" because the \"i\" in \"a[i]\" is evaluated (to 3) before it is assigned 4.",
"Similarly, the line",
"\3     x, y = y, x",
"\4",
"exchanges the values of \"x\" and \"y\", and",
"\3     x, y, z = y, z, x",
"\4",
"cyclically permutes the values of \"x\", \"y\", and \"z\".",
"\4",
"The meaning of assignments to global variables and table fields can be changed via metatables.",
"An assignment to an indexed variable \"t[i] = val\" is equivalent to \"settable_event(t,i,val)\".",
"(See §2.8 for a complete description of the \"settable_event\" function.",
"This function is not defined or callable in Lua.",
"We use it here only for explanatory purposes.)",
"\4",
"An assignment to a global variable \"x = val\" is equivalent to the assignment \"_env.x = val\", which in turn is equivalent to",
"\3     settable_event(_env, \"x\", val)",
"\4",
"where \"_env\" is the environment of the running function.",
"(The \"_env\" variable is not defined in Lua.",
"We use it here only for explanatory purposes.)",
},
{ title = "2.4.4 Control Structures", typ = 1;
"\4",
"The control structures if, while, and repeat have the usual meaning and familiar syntax:",
"\3\9stat ::= while exp do block end",
"\3\9stat ::= repeat block until exp",
"\3\9stat ::= if exp then block {elseif exp then block} [else block] end",
"\4",
"Lua also has a for statement, in two flavors (see §2.4.5).",
"\4",
"The condition expression of a control structure can return any value.",
"Both false and nil are considered false.",
"All values different from nil and false are considered true (in particular, the number 0 and the empty string are also true).",
"\4",
"In the repeat-until loop, the inner block does not end at the until keyword, but only after the condition.",
"So, the condition can refer to local variables declared inside the loop block.",
"\4",
"The return statement is used to return values from a function or a chunk (which is just a function).",
"Functions and chunks can return more than one value, and so the syntax for the return statement is",
"\3\9stat ::= return [explist]",
"\4",
"The break statement is used to terminate the execution of a while, repeat, or for loop, skipping to the next statement after the loop:",
"\3\9stat ::= break",
"\4",
"A break ends the innermost enclosing loop.",
"\4",
"The return and break statements can only be written as the last statement of a block.",
"If it is really necessary to return or break in the middle of a block, then an explicit inner block can be used, as in the idioms \"do return end\" and \"do break end\", because now return and break are the last statements in their (inner) blocks.",
},
{ title = "2.4.5 For Statement", typ = 1;
"\4",
"The for statement has two forms: one numeric and one generic.",

"It has the following syntax:",
"\3\9stat ::= for Name `=´ exp `,´ exp [`,´ exp] do block end",
"\4",
"The block is repeated for name starting at the value of the first exp, until it passes the second exp by steps of the third exp.",

"In the case of a yield, \"coroutine.resume\" also returns true, plus any values passed to \"coroutine.yield\".",
"The next time you resume the same coroutine, it continues its execution from the point where it yielded, with the call to \"coroutine.yield\" returning any extra arguments passed to \"coroutine.resume\".",

"Although Lua has been designed as an extension language, to be embedded in a host C program, it is also frequently used as a stand-alone language.",
"An interpreter for Lua as a stand-alone language, called simply \"lua\", is provided with the standard distribution.",
"The stand-alone interpreter includes all standard libraries, including the debug library.",
"Its usage is:",
"\3     lua [options] [script [args]]",
"\4",
"The options are:",
"\2\"-e stat\": executes string stat;",
"\2\"-l mod\": \"requires\" mod;",
"\2\"-i\": enters interactive mode after running script;",
"\2\"-v\": prints version information;",
"\2\"--\": stops handling options;",
"\2\"-\": executes \"stdin\" as a file and stops handling options.",
"\2",
"\4",
"After handling its options, \"lua\" runs the given script, passing to it the given args as string arguments.",
"When called without arguments, \"lua\" behaves as \"lua -v -i\" when the standard input (\"stdin\") is a terminal, and as \"lua -\" otherwise.",
"\4",
"Before running any argument, the interpreter checks for an environment variable \"LUA_INIT\".",
"If its format is \"@filename\", then \"lua\" executes the file.",
"Otherwise, \"lua\" executes the string itself.",
"\4",
"All options are handled in order, except \"-i\".",
"For instance, an invocation like",
"\3     $ lua -e'a=1' -e 'print(a)' script.lua",
"\4",
"will first set \"a\" to 1, then print the value of \"a\" (which is \"1\"), and finally run the file \"script.lua\" with no arguments.",
"(Here \"$\" is the shell prompt. Your prompt may be different.)",
"\4",
"Before starting to run the script, \"lua\" collects all arguments in the command line in a global table called \"arg\".",
"The script name is stored at index 0, the first argument after the script name goes to index 1, and so on.",
"Any arguments before the script name (that is, the interpreter name plus the options) go to negative indices.",
"For instance, in the call",
"\3     $ lua -la b.lua t1 t2",
"\4",
"the interpreter first runs the file \"a.lua\", then creates a table",
"\3     arg = { [-2] = \"lua\", [-1] = \"-la\",",
"\3             [0] = \"b.lua\",",
"\3             [1] = \"t1\", [2] = \"t2\" }",
"\4",
"and finally runs the file \"b.lua\".",
"The script is called with \"arg[1]\", \"arg[2]\", ... as arguments; it can also access these arguments with the vararg expression \"...\".",
"\4",
"In interactive mode, if you write an incomplete statement, the interpreter waits for its completion by issuing a different prompt.",
"\4",
"If the global variable \"_PROMPT\" contains a string, then its value is used as the prompt.",
"Similarly, if the global variable \"_PROMPT2\" contains a string, its value is used as the secondary prompt (issued during incomplete statements).",
"Therefore, both prompts can be changed directly on the command line or in any Lua programs by assigning to \"_PROMPT\".",
"See the next example:",
"\3     $ lua -e\"_PROMPT='myprompt> '\" -i",
"\4",
"(The outer pair of quotes is for the shell, the inner pair is for Lua.)",
"Note the use of \"-i\" to enter interactive mode; otherwise, the program would just end silently right after the assignment to \"_PROMPT\".",
"\4",
"To allow the use of Lua as a script interpreter in Unix systems, the stand-alone interpreter skips the first line of a chunk if it starts with \"#\".",
"Therefore, Lua scripts can be made into executable programs by using \"chmod +x\" and the \"#!\" form, as in",
"\3     #!/usr/local/bin/lua",
"\4",
"(Of course, the location of the Lua interpreter may be different in your machine.",
